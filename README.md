# 30-Days-of-Python

This is a self paced study guide to Python by learning and answering tests from Asabeneh's 30 Days of Python.
I choose this over a course or tutorial since at the end of each topic or day there are questions for you to answer.
If you are interested in my approach to learning Python, please visit Asabeneh's Python repository on this link: https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python
On his profile you can find other courses/ languages to learn such as Javascript, React, CSS etc.
